# ai-course-template

Starting scaffold for the FiftyFive AI engineering course. One repo per track, grown phase by
phase by hand.

## Use it

```bash
gh repo create FiftyfiveTech/ai-course-<track> --template FiftyfiveTech/ai-course-template --public --clone
cd ai-course-<track>
make setup
```

Then, in order: replace `<TRACK>` in `CLAUDE.md` and `pyproject.toml`, protect `main`, add the
other person as a collaborator with push access.

## Layout

| Path | Holds |
|---|---|
| `src/` | The system. Small modules, one job each. |
| `config.toml` | Every cost or quality lever — frame sampling rate, audio target, sample spec. Read only by `src/config.py`, which refuses to default a missing lever. |
| `samples/` | Sample videos, **generated or fetched, never committed**. `make sample` writes a synthetic clip; `make sample-real VIDEO_ID=…` pulls one dev video from its manifest url. |
| `runs/` | Ingest output, one directory per video: `audio.wav`, `frames/`, `media.json`. Gitignored. |
| `data/corpus/` | The 10-video pilot corpus: **pointers only**, never media. `manifest.json` + `PROVENANCE.md` (licence, provenance, how the split was chosen). |
| `prompts/` | Versioned prompt files (`extract_v1.md`, `extract_v2.md`, …). Never inline a prompt in code. |
| `schemas/` | Pydantic models. Structured output is validated, not parsed by hand. |
| `evals/dev/` | **Builder** tunes here. 15 cases. |
| `evals/heldout/` | **Evaluator** only. Sealed Wednesday, tagged `heldout-v1`. The Builder never reads it. |
| `tests/gates/` | One script per phase gate. It prints the number; the number decides. |
| `STANDUP.md` | Daily log. Two minutes, append-only. |

## Deliberately missing

Two files are absent because they are Week 0 tasks, not scaffolding:

- `tests/gates/test_no_leakage.py` — asserts `evals/dev ∩ evals/heldout = ∅` by content hash
  (task **0.7**). Until it exists, the blind-labelling rule is unenforced.
- `src/telemetry.py` — the shared cost/latency logger every model call goes through (task **0.8**).

Write them. Do not import them from somewhere else.

## Rules that live in this repo

`CLAUDE.md` carries the full contract. The short version:

- Models and datasets are named by **Hugging Face repo id**. The provider is only where it runs.
- **Zero spend.** A paid call is a STOP-and-ask, never a judgement call.
- A phase is done when its gate **prints the number**, not when the code looks right.
- Every PR is reviewed by the other person. `main` is protected; self-merges are the one thing
  the Friday retro always checks.
- Tasks come from the Odoo board via the `odoo-board` MCP server, not from this README.
